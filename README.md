AlcoholClass.py README
There are two modules being used that are not standard with the python library. Versions greater than python 3.4 come preinstalled with pip.
We will be using pip to install both the necesarry modules for this program to execute. 

On windows
-From start run CMD. You can just search for it.
-inside the CMD module type
-pip install klepto
-pip install XlsxWriter

Finished for the most part. If you find any bugs please report them to me. I have some more ideas on what I can do to add to it later.
